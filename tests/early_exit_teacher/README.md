# Early Exit Visualization

The [visualization](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/MeridianResearch/externalization/blob/karthik/tests/early_exit_teacher/visualizations/early_exit_analysis.html) and [code](https://github.com/MeridianResearch/externalization/blob/karthik/tests/early_exit_teacher/early_exit_predictions.py) consists of three modes:

1. Normal generation without early exiting
2. Early exiting without freezing
3. Early exiting with frozen residual stream after exiting
